Hi!

I'm an Economics PhD Student
at the University of Pennsylvania.

My research interests are in time series econometrics,
with applications in (international) macro-finance.

Why Does a Dominant Currency Replace Another?, with A. Mehl & I. van Robays (European Central Bank)
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>

  This paper assesses why a dominant international currency can be replaced with another by contrasting two hypotheses - a "trade" shock and an "exchange rate volatility" shock" - stressed in recent theoretical models (Gopinath & Stein (2021) and Mukhin (2022)). We use as a laboratory 13 European economies that saw marked increases in use of the euro at the expense of the US dollar for international trade invoicing over 1999-2019. We exploit the cross-sectional dispersion in the timing, speed and extent of the increase in euro-invoicing over time and use  theory-consistent identification assumptions to identify the shocks in a panel vector autoregression allowing for cross-country effects emphasized in theory. Our empirical estimates point to a substantial role  of the "exchange rate volatility" shock.

Sequential Monte Carlo with Model Tempering, with F. Schorfheide (University of Pennsylvania)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  In this paper we start from the posterior distribution of an approximating model for which sampling is fast and then use a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm to reweight and mutate the initial draws into posterior draws from a model of inter- est. This technique can significantly speed up posterior computations for models for which likelihood evaluations are time-consuming (due to model solution or filtering). We apply the technique to the estimation of a vector autoregression with stochastic volatility and a nonlinear dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. The runtime reductions we obtain range from 27% to 88%.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  We develop a structural VAR in which an occasionally-binding constraint generates censoring of one of the dependent variables. Once the censoring mechanism is triggered, we allow some of the coefficients for the remaining variables to change. We show that a necessary condition for a unique reduced form is that regression functions for the non-censored variables are continuous at the censoring point and that parameters satisfy some mild restrictions. In our application the censored variable is a nominal interest rate constrained by an effective lower bound (ELB). According to our estimates based on U.S. data, once the ELB becomes binding, the coefficients in the inflation equation change significantly, which translates into a change of the inflation responses to (unconventional) monetary policy and demand shocks. Our results suggest that the presence of the ELB is indeed empirically relevant for the propagation of shocks. We also obtain a shadow interest rate that shows a significant accommodation in the early phase of the Great Recession, followed by a mild and steady accommodation until liftoff in 2016.
