Hi!

I'm an Economics PhD Student
at the University of Pennsylvania.

My research interests are in time series econometrics,
with applications in (international) macro-finance.

**Why Does a Dominant Currency Replace Another?,** with A. Mehl & I. van Robays (European Central Bank)
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>

  This paper assesses why a dominant currency in international trade invoicing can be replaced with another by contrasting two hypotheses — a “trade shock” and an “exchange rate volatility shock” — stressed in recent theoretical models (Gopinath and Stein (2021) and Mukhin (2022)). We study the unique case of 13 European economies that saw marked increases in use of the euro at the expense of the US dollar for international trade invoicing. Our empirical analysis uses theory-consistent identification assumptions to identify the shocks in a panel vector autoregression, allowing for cross-country effects emphasized in theory. This setup allows us to exploit the cross-sectional dispersion in timing, speed and extent of the increase in euro-invoicing over time. Our estimates point to a preponderant role of inertia and to a stronger role of the “exchange rate volatility” shock relative to the “trade shock” in invoicing decision dynamics. Greater stability of both domestic and trading partners’ currencies vis-à-vis the euro explains about 3-13% of the increase in EUR invoicing across countries. This is consistent with predictions of models emphasizing the importance of changes to exchange rate pegs as necessary condition to break input-output linkages and complementarities in price setting that induce exporters to coordinate on the same incumbent invoicing currency.

**Sequential Monte Carlo with Model Tempering,** with F. Schorfheide (University of Pennsylvania) \

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  Modern macroeconometrics often relies on time series models for which it is time- consuming to evaluate the likelihood function. We demonstrate how Bayesian computations for such models can be drastically accelerated by reweighting and mutating posterior draws from an approximating model that allows for fast likelihood evaluations, into posterior draws from the model of interest, using a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm. We apply the technique to the estimation of a vector autoregression with stochastic volatility and a nonlinear dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. The runtime reductions we obtain range from 27% to 88%.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  We develop a structural VAR in which an occasionally-binding constraint generates censoring of one of the dependent variables. Once the censoring mechanism is triggered, we allow some of the coefficients for the remaining variables to change. We show that a necessary condition for a unique reduced form is that regression functions for the non-censored variables are continuous at the censoring point and that parameters satisfy some mild restrictions. In our application the censored variable is a nominal interest rate constrained by an effective lower bound (ELB). According to our estimates based on U.S. data, once the ELB becomes binding, the coefficients in the inflation equation change significantly, which translates into a change of the inflation responses to (unconventional) monetary policy and demand shocks. Our results suggest that the presence of the ELB is indeed empirically relevant for the propagation of shocks. We also obtain a shadow interest rate that shows a significant accommodation in the early phase of the Great Recession, followed by a mild and steady accommodation until liftoff in 2016.
