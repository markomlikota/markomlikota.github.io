# PhD Applications & "Swiss Scholarships"


Admissions to the PhD program at the Geneva Graduate Institute are not decided by individual professors. There is a process which starts with a formal application (click [[here]][AdmissionsWebsiteLink] for more information). Each application is then evaluated by a group of professors who also decide on admission.
​Hence, I am unable to commit to supervise students who have not yet been admitted.
​
If you need a letter to apply for a Swiss Scholarship or more information about the applications process, please contact the admission office at: prospective@graduateinstitute.ch
